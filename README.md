Friday Project 7

Project 1 Notes
# Let's rewrite the code to allow user input for each part of the madlib.
# Getting inputs from the user
# Returning the madlib with the user inputs
# Let's call the function to allow user interaction

Project 2 Notes
# This function generates 6 lottery numbers:
# - The first 5 numbers are randomly selected from a range of 1 to 69
# - The last number is randomly selected from a range of 1 to 26
# It then displays the numbers with specific spacing and provides a farewell message.
# Generate the first 5 numbers between 1 and 69
# Generate the last number between 1 and 26
# Format the output with spaces (3 spaces between the 5th and 6th number)
# Display the generated numbers
# Call the Function
