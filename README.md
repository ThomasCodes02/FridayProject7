Friday Project 7

Project 1 Notes
# Let's rewrite the code to allow user input for each part of the madlib.
# Getting inputs from the user
# Returning the madlib with the user inputs
# Let's call the function to allow user interaction

Project 2 Notes
# This function generates 6 lottery numbers:
# - The first 5 numbers are randomly selected from a range of 1 to 69
# - The last number is randomly selected from a range of 1 to 26
# It then displays the numbers with specific spacing and provides a farewell message.
# Generate the first 5 numbers between 1 and 69
# Generate the last number between 1 and 26
# Format the output with spaces (3 spaces between the 5th and 6th number)
# Display the generated numbers
# Call the Function

Project 3 Notes
# Importing the random module to generate random numbers
# Ask the user if they want to play the game and convert the input to lowercase
# Check if the user said "yes"
# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
# Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10, and convert it to an integer
# Check if the guessed number matches the random number
# If the guess is correct, print a congratulatory message
# If the guess is incorrect, show the correct number and prompt them to try again
# Call the function to start the game
Project 4 Notes 
# Define the trivia questions and answers
# Loop through the dictionary and prompt the user for answers
# Display the question
# Check if the answer is correct and provide feedback
# # Add a newline for spacing
